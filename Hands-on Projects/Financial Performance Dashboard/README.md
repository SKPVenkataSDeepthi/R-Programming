# Financial Performance Dashboard

An interactive **R Shiny dashboard** for visualizing corporate financial metrics — including **quarterly revenue** and **expenses** across departments.  
This project demonstrates data-driven decision support using **Shiny**, **Plotly**, and **dplyr**, and can be extended for real business data.

## Features

- **Interactive Charts** — visualize revenue and expense trends by department  
- **Dynamic Filters** — select departments to filter key metrics in real time  
- **Clean Dashboard UI** — built using `shinydashboard` for a professional layout  
- **Data Insights** — clear quarterly breakdowns for quick KPI interpretation

## How It Works

- **Synthetic Data Generation** — the app creates quarterly revenue and expense data for each department.
- **Reactive Filtering** — users select a department from the sidebar; charts update dynamically.
- **Interactive Visualization** — revenue is displayed as bars, expenses as line plots for easy comparison.

## Output

When you select R&D department:
- **Left Plot** → Quarterly Revenue (bar chart)
- **Right Plot** → Quarterly Expense Trend (line chart)
You’ll see interactive hover values and zoom functionality (via Plotly).
